#### Programming part:
1. Minimal Spanning Tree 
2. Dynamic Programming and Divide and conquer
3. Project: NP-complete problem; Vertex Cover: Use the local search algorithm of 2 stage exchange with weight forgetting, referenced the latest
  paper https://www.jair.org/media/3907/live-3907-6992-jair.pdf with some improvement on the weight forgetting stage for better performance.
